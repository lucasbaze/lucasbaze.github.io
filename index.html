  						I really don't know what to put here. I have a ton of hobby ideas. Here are some of the most influential books that have made an impression on me. I like to make things. I started a startup that failed catastrophically. I started a student organization that failed. I've started a chess camp that failed. I've been a swim coach for my neighborhood. I've lied, cheated, and stolen things, and had the same done to me. I wake up mostly happy to be alive. I like the idea of creating big things, but currently don't have the motivation to do them really. I love most things. I REALLY wanted to be important, but I've recently realized that it's not worth it. I am at peace.

  						NOW:
  						Currently working at OutboundEngine as a Customer Success Representative. Working on converting my truck into a liveable van. Building a website to sell posters about books I like. Enjoying my time traveling.
